NODE JS :

1->Node doesn't have a predefined "window" object cause it doesn't have a window to draw anything.

2->In this Node "location" object is related to a particular url; that means it is for page specific. So, node doesn't require that.

3-> It doesn't have "document" object also, cause it never have to render anything in a page.

4->In Node everything is a module. You must keep your code inside a module.

5->in Node processes request object.



BROWSER(JS) : 

1->"window" is a predefined global object which has functions and attributes, that have to deal with window that has been drawn.

2->document", which is also another predefined global variable in browsers, has the html which is rendered.

3->Browsers may have an object named "global", but it will be the exact one as "window".


4->Â Moduling is not mandatory in client side JavaScript.

5-> Browsers processes response objects.
